On September 9th, with the full release of Tableau 2021.3 we moved the latest version of the master branch to target Tableau 2021.3. This means that the samples and connectors made with this version of the SDK may not work with older versions of Tableau. To develop against Tableau 2021.2, please download the [Tableau Connector SDK for Tableau 2021.2](https://github.com/tableau/connector-plugin-sdk/releases/tag/tableau-2021.2) release.
