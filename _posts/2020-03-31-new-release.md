abstract: "The Connector SDK for 2019.4 has released for those wishing to target that version. The main SDK branch now targets Tableau 2020.1"

On March 11th, with the full release of Tableau 2020.1 we moved the latest version of the master branch to target Tableau 2020.1. This means that the samples and connectors made with this version of the SDK may not work with older versions of Tableau. To develop against Tableau 2019.4, please download the [Tableau Connector SDK for Tableau 2019.4](https://github.com/tableau/connector-plugin-sdk/releases/tag/tableau-2019.4) release.

One of the new features is the addition of three new customizable text fields called Vendor Attributes! We have instructions on how to use them in our [documentation](https://tableau.github.io/connector-plugin-sdk/docs/ui), and you can see an example of them in a working connector in our Postgres JDBC sample connector [here](https://github.com/tableau/connector-plugin-sdk/tree/master/samples/plugins/postgres_jdbc).
