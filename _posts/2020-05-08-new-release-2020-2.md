abstract: "The master SDK branch now targets Tableau 2020.2. The Connector SDK for 2020.1 has released for those wishing to target that version."

On May 8th, with the full release of Tableau 2020.2 we moved the latest version of the master branch to target Tableau 2020.2. This means that the samples and connectors made with this version of the SDK may not work with older versions of Tableau. To develop against Tableau 2020.1, please download the [Tableau Connector SDK for Tableau 2020.1](https://github.com/tableau/connector-plugin-sdk/releases/tag/tableau-2020.1) release.

We've updated the packager tool to prepare for the upcoming Connection Dialogs v2 feature, which will allow for more flexible connection dialogs.
