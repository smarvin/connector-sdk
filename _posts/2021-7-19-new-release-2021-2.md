abstract: "The master SDK branch now targets Tableau 2021.2. The Connector SDK for 2021.1 has released for those wishing to target that version."

On March 29th, with the full release of Tableau 2021.2 we moved the latest version of the master branch to target Tableau 2021.2. This means that the samples and connectors made with this version of the SDK may not work with older versions of Tableau. To develop against Tableau 2021.1, please download the [Tableau Connector SDK for Tableau 2021.1](https://github.com/tableau/connector-plugin-sdk/releases/tag/tableau-2021.1) release.

- __Extract Only Connector Web Authoring__ <br/>
Starting in 2021.2, extract only connectors created with the Tableau Connector SDK now support web authoring, allowing you to create new connections on Tableau Server for those connectors.

- __Deprecated connection-matcher and connection-normalizer JavaScript files__ <br/>
Using JavaScript files for connection-matcher and connection-normalizer has been deprecated since Tableau 2020.3, but starting with Tableau 2021.2 connectors using those files will throw an error when being loaded.
